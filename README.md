# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

In this Homework assignment we were tasked to fully deploy our understanding of Jqerry. We had to dynamicly manipulate the DOM. we had to utilize the resourse that is API calls to power our webpage with a huge database of information. We also had to use our local storage to store and retrieve information

## General Criteria

We want a Web page that given a city will give us detailed information about he current weather and about the 5 day forcast. We also want to be able to recall past searches and use that as another method of displaying the cities weather and forcast. 
```

## Given Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
